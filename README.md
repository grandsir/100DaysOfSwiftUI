# What is 100 Days Of SwiftUI?
It's free course which has been created by Paul Hadson. It's a new version (SwiftUI) of 100 Days Of Swift (which uses UIKit)

Footnote:  The all "100 Days" series serve one purpose: "Making a habit". So, this course gives you a habit at Swift and that's also why I used Paul's course to learn.

# Log

## Day 1:

Day 1 was very simple. It's about variables, Data types, strings etc.

## Day 2:

Day 2 was quite bit harder than Day 1. It was about Arrays, sets, tuples, dicts, enums etc.

## Day 3:
Day 3 was easy. The rules inherited from math. I think the most important part is `switch-case` statements and `range operators`.

## Day 4:

Day 4 was about the loops. Exiting multiple loops were interesting.

## Day 5:

The Day 5 was really awesome! The tests were magnifical and I learned `inout` parameters, throwing functions, and I applied them to my older projects!

## Day 6:
Well, the day 6 was hard. Anonymous functions is hard to grasp in every language.

## Day 7:
Oh god, the day 7 was like a torture. It was much more harder than I excepted. I just spend 2-3 hours to figure out what it means or how to use it.

## Day 8:
Day 8 was funny. I learned a new stuff called `Property Observers`!

## Day 9:
Day 9 was very impressive. I finished `structs`, learned `lazy properties` etc.

## Day 10:
I have a basic knowledge of many programming languages but I've never heard of `Deinitialization`. That was quite interesting but 60 seconds explanation wasn't enough for me.

## Day 11: 
I learned `protocols`, `extensions` and `protocol extensions`. To be honest, I didn't understand the topic very well so, I am expecting to use protocols in the project

## Day 12:
Wow, Day 12 was harder than Day 7 but I think I have the basics now. Then it's time to learn SwiftUI!

## Day 13-14-15:
I finished reviews.

## Day 16:
I started to WeSplit and learned Form, Group, Section

## Day 17:
Wow, that was awesome but there was a bug in the code. `iOS 14.0` automatically makes uppercased all headers so you need to add `.textCase(nil)` in `Section.`

## Day 18:
Finished Challange!

## Day 19:
Day 19 was hard for me but I did it!

## Day 20:
Day 20 was a disappointment for me. Paul has a great teaching technique but he sometimes explains really superficially
## Day 21:
I started to Guess the flag project!

## Day 22:
I finished challanges and also project 2!

## Day 23:
Actually Project 3 wasn't a project but I don't care because the topics were great

## Day 24:
Completed 3 simple challanges.

## Day 25:
Finished Reviews. Also, the challange was fun!

## Day 26:
I not very interested in machine learning but... I'll try.

## Day 27:
Yes, I am absolutely not interested in machine learning... Finished project 4.

## Day 28:
Challange was fun!

## Day 29:
